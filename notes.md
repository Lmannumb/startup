## AWS Notes

It went alright.

## HTML Notes

I be poppin bottles.

## CSS Notes

There is a lot of stuff. A lot of details.

## React 1 Notes

These packages are pretty useful. I haven't even had to actually do anything! Luckily for me everything worked on the second try. Vite is bundled. Router is implemented. Billions must interact.

## React 2 Notes

Goodness Gracious, I hate working with javascript. I was trying to fix a problem with react states for a solid 2 hour period, and when I came back after a break, the bug was gone, and I have not seen it since.

## Webservice Notes

Web design is definitely a work of the devil. Meow!

## DB Notes

As expected, this one is going pretty easy. I only really need to change a few lines of code for each function, so that the arrays come from the database rather than local variables.
